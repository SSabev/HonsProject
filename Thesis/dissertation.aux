For Sochi the Olympiad has bumped the correlation coefficient up to 0.77, because people were tweeting and wanted to go and see the Olympiad. Ukraine is interesting, because the recent protests decreased the number of searches even though people were tweeting a lot, therefore the recent events made them less likely to want to go there. North Korea is an interesting outlier. Tourist to North Korea is quite a niche market and even though the sentiment is usually negative, people want to go there nonetheless. \relax }}{19}}
